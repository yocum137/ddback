REQUIREMENTS
============

rsync
nfs-utils

(optionally)
hal
gnome-config
gnome-volume-manager

============
INSTALLATION 
============

OPTION #1
=========

Get the rpm, install it, configure it (See CONFIGURATION, below), run it.  Done.


OPTION #2
=========

Get the tarball, unpack it, run 'make install' to install everything, configure it 
(See CONFIGURATION, below), run it.  Done.

If you don't want/have autorun capability, then run 'make install-core; make 
install-doc'.  

=============
CONFIGURATION
=============

METHOD #1 - simple, straightforward, run-by-hand, no autorun.
-------------------------------------------------------------

1) Edit /etc/sysconfig/ddback and set the environment variables for your system.  

   The BACKUP_DIR is where your removable media gets mounted by hal (if you're using
   a Red Hat based distro with Gnome).

   RO_VOLUME is the read-only NFS mount point that ddback will mount so it can do 
   the backups.  Oh, you'll need nfs-utils installed (if you install the rpm, it 
   should have told you this).

2) Edit /etc/ddback.conf and add the volumes you want to back up.  Use the examples
   as a guideline.

3) Edit the appropriate excludes file(s) in /etc/ddback.d/ and add the files you
   don't want backed up.  For instance, in the home-excludes I have 'Cache' and 
   '.beagle', so my Mozilla Cache files are skipped as well as the beagle index 
   files.

4) Plug in your USB drive, make sure it's mounted where you think it is (i.e., 
   run 'df -l').

5) Login as root and run /sbin/ddback.

6) Watch the log file grow (i.e., 'tail -f /var/log/ddback/ddback<DATE>.log').



METHOD #2 -  Fancy shmancy, automatic on drive insertion (for Gnome desktops).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This assumes you either installed the rpm package or did a 'make install' to install
all the components.  

Do all the configuration stuff in METHOD #1, first.  

1) If you don't have the gnome-config and gnome-volume-manager rpm packages 
   installed, install them (i.e., 'yum install gnome-config gnome-volume-manager').

2) Run 'gnome-config' and browse to schemas -> desktop -> gnome.  Select
   "volume_manager", select "autorun_path," right click and select 'Edit,' add
   a "string" and enter this in the entry field (w/o the single quotes):
   '.autorun:autorun:autorun.sh'

	NB: On FC6, I had to remove the autorun_path schema entry because it wasn't
	edittable, then re-add it setting it up as above.  Make sure you name it
	correctly (i.e., autorun_path).

3) Mount your USB drive and copy the autorun.example to /path/to/usb-drive/autorun.
   Then right click on the drive on your desktop, click the "drive" tab, expand the
   "settings" section and add "exec" to the mount options.  

4) Unmount the drive, unplug the drive, plug the drive back in and you should be 
   prompted if you would like to allow autorun to run.  Then you should be prompted
   for the root password.

5) Watch the log file grow (i.e., 'tail -f /var/log/ddback/ddback<DATE>.log').

RESTORING FILES
===============

What could be easier?  They're in $BACKUP_DIR/$HOSTNAME/{current,incrmental}/$VOL 
directories.  Go find what you want, and copy it back to where it came from.
